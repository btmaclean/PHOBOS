# PHOBOS
A Python 2.7 pipeline for high-resolution spectroscopic parameter and abundance analysis using MOOG, ARES, makekurucz3.

Originally written to handle globular cluster spectra from the multi-fibre HERMES facility on the AAT (Siding Spring Observatory). Phobos can be easily adapted for data from other high-facilities, or for different stellar targets (where reliable photometric values and distances are known).
