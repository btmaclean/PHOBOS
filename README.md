# PHOBOS

Phobos is a Python 2.7 pipeline for high-resolution spectroscopic parameter and abundance analysis following the ARES+MOOG analysis
method (Sousa, 2014; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1407.5817S).

Originally written to handle globular cluster spectra from the multi-fibre HERMES facility on the AAT (Siding Spring Observatory),
Phobos can be easily adapted for data from other high-facilities, or for different stellar targets (where reliable photometric
values and distances are known).
